                  <i>Steve McCown is a Chief Architect at Anonyome Labs where he conducts R&D for decentralized identity, privacy, and cryptographic projects.  Recently, McCown was appointed by Governor Cox of Utah to the state’s Personal Privacy Oversight Commission to help develop standards for protecting personal data on state IT systems.  McCown also serves as a Co-Chair of the DID Communication working group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation in order to develop more secure and private communications.  During his career, McCown has invented several patented mobile payment and security technologies and in 2008 launched a mobile payment system enabling customers to tap their phones on NFC-compatible credit card terminals for purchasing.  While at the Idaho National Laboratory (U.S. Dept. of Energy), he performed security vulnerability discovery for computing systems and mobile devices.  He also created a method for standard cellphones to detect ionizing radiation (from ‘dirty bombs’) and phone home to alert first responders.  While serving as a U.S. Air Force officer, he led virtual reality research and built post-mission analysis systems for the AWACS aircraft.  McCown has earned B.S. & M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Brigham Young University, holds Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) and Certified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer (CDPSE) certifications, and is an inventor on 29 patents. </i>

                        <i>I am the CTO/co-founder at Cheqd, an open source decentralised identity startup and I’ve been working on decentralised identity projects since 2017 in a range of industry sectors, such as government/law enforcement, healthcare, financial services, travel etc. Prior to founding Cheqd in 2021, I worked in biometrics & digital identity at Accenture, a global consulting company (2017-2019); IDWorks, a digital identity startup (2020); and R3, an enterprise blockchain scale-up behind the Corda blockchain framework (2020-2021). I believe this range of experience in different types of companies - startups, scale-ups, and mid-large enterprises/government - gives me unique insight on the needs and wants of Decentralised Identity Foundation’s membership base. I’m familiar with doing this within the context of open source, as one of the key architects behind Hyperledger Bevel; and now on the Cheqd network where I architected ideas such as DID-Linked Resources.

If decentralised identity is to become commonplace, it needs to be easy to use and build for everyone who is NOT a member of DIF. Therefore, if elected to the DIF Steering Committee, I’d be interested in improving developer relationships (“DevRel”) with experts as well as newcomers to decentralised identity. I’m passionate about mentoring people new to product management and engineering, especially if they come from disadvantaged/overlooked backgrounds, and I have been deeply involved in organising hackathons, mentoring programmes, startup incubators etc for towards this goal. I’d love to bring some of these playbooks and implement them among DIF’s audience.</i>
